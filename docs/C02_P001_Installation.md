## Installing RStudio

RStudio provides a more feature-rich graphical user interface (GUI) for using R and writing R scripts. It is highly recommended to install RStudio if you plan on using R extensively. To install RStudio, you can go to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and choose the Download link. Select the link for the installer matching your operating system (look to the right of the version number for 'macOS' or 'Windows'). As before, you can then follow the instructions of the installation wizard for the downloaded file to install RStudio on your system.

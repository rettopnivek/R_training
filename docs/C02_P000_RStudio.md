## RStudio

R is a programming language, and using R typically involves typing out commands into a console window, or running a script with a sequence of commands. However, a graphical user interface, or more accurately, an integrated developer environment (IDE), does exist for R, to help streamline the process of saving/loading files, creating R data and script files, and setting internal options for R. Unfortunately, this interface is somewhat barebones. Therefore, we will focus on the more feature-rich IDE provided by RStudio (which is most reminiscent of Matlab's interface).

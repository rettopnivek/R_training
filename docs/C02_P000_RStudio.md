## RStudio

R is a programming language, and using R typically involves typing out commands into a console window, or running a script with a sequence of commands. However, a GUI does exist for R, to help streamline the process of saving/loading files, creating R data and script files, and setting internal options for R. Unfortunately, this GUI is somewhat barebones. Therefore, we will focus on the more feature-rich GUI provided by RStudio (which is most reminiscent of Matlab's interface).

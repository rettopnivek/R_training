### Installing R

To install R, you can go to https://www.r-project.org/ and click the **download R** link. Select a CRAN mirror location near you (scroll down to near the bottom for locations in the US). On the next page, select the link corresponding to your operating system. The following page provides additional options - typically, you will want to choose **install R for the first time** and click the download link on the next page. You can then follow the instructions of the installation wizard for the downloaded file to install R on your system.


### Installing RStudio

RStudio provides a more feature-rich graphical user interface (GUI) for using R and writing R scripts. It is highly recommended to install RStudio if you plan on using R extensively. To install RStudio, you can go to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and choose the **Download** link. Select the link for the installer matching your operating system (look to the right of the version number for 'macOS' or 'Windows'). As before, you can then follow the instructions of the installation wizard for the downloaded file to install RStudio on your system.

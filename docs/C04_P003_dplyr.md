## The 'dplyr' R package

Over the years, a large number of data scientists have made significant extensions to R to help make it easier to use for applied researchers. At the forefront of this is a large suite of R packages developed primarily by Hadley Wickham, which now go by the name 'tidyverse'. Because Hadley Wickham now works for the company behind RStudio, this RStudio has very nice integration with these packages and vice versa.

In this section, I focus on the package 'dplyr', which provides powerful tools for manipulating data frames. Processing data frames to prep data for analyses can be a time-consuming and complicated process, resulting in dense code. The package 'dplyr' can make this code much more readible, via intuitive function names and a special operator, '%>%' (the pipe operator), which enables stringing together several function calls in an interptable way.

## Updating R

The developers and maintainers of R regularly update the software. However, R also allows users to create their own extensions in the form of R packages, and there is now a sizable library of such extensions. Therefore, rather then simply automatically updating R, instead updated versions are treated as separate installations, to make backwards compatibility easier.

This means that...
1. R will not automatically update - instead you will need to go and download the newest version when you see fit;
2. You can have multiple versions of R installed on your computer.

To install the latest version of R, simply repeat the steps outlined in the [installation](C01_P001_R_installation.md) section.

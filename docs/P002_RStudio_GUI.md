## The RStudio Graphical User Interface (GUI)

R is a programming language, and using R typically involves typing out commands into a console window, or running a script with a sequence of commands. However, a GUI does exist for R, to help streamline the process of saving/loading files, creating R data and script files, and setting internal options for R. Unfortunately, this GUI is somewhat barebones. Therefore, we will focus on the more feature-rich GUI provided by RStudio (which is most reminiscent of Matlab's interface).

RStudio provides four panes meant to display:
* The __console__ window;
* The __R script__ files;
* The __viewer__ window (e.g., for displaying plots);
* An additional window for ancillary information.

In the following, I provide a series of examples of using R in applied settings, with a focus on applications for clinical/psychiatric research and data processing. These examples are meant to be intuitive and accessible, for people without much experience in programming.

### Why R?

R is a programming language with a focus on data processing, data visualization, and statistical analyses. If you intend on regularly processing data, especially with the end-goal of performing statistical analyses (or preparing data for someone else to run statistical analyses), R is designed specifically to aid in this goal. Writing data processing, visualization, and analysis scripts in R can help, for example, with:
1. Ensuring reproducibility (scripts can be easily rerun and annotated with notes);
2. Avoiding common transcription/processing errors;
3. Enabling portability and making it easier to share work with labmates;
4. Providing a larger toolset for data-checking.

Additionally, R has simple and intuitive means for extensions via **R packages**, allowing users to download additional software specific to their current problem. As a starting place for learning how to program, R can be easier then other languages (e.g., Java or C++), especially because it has a large, diverse user base and plenty of resources built around non-programmers and applied examples.

### Resources for R

R is a popular language, and there are a great many books and online tutorials written on R. Below are some example links:
* A [R cheat sheet](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf), a PDF file listing R commands (useful to consult if you are trying to remember a standard R command).
* [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/), an online book by Danielle Navarro for teaching introductory statistics to psychology students.
* [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Introduction.html), a online book by Hadley Wickham (aimed at intermediate to advanced users of R, useful to consult if you want more in-depth knowledge about how R works and how to best use it).
* [Additional links](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/learning-to-work-with-r) provided by the Association for Psychological Science.
